      "This was a 3D modeling competition hosted by the UW association of Mechanical Engineers that I entered into with a friend named Emily Cameron (https://www.linkedin.com/in/emilycameron/). The prompt was, 'what is the future of transportation?', with a bonus prompt of 'include a safety feature somewhere in your creation.",
      "Given that our school is near Puget Sound, we decided to create a car that was capable of converting into a boat. in the week we had, we were able to focus on a creative design and related features. These included a fully articulated, luxury cabin, dual fire extinguishers per coast guard regulations, large engine with propeller, a front locker for storage, and a chassis that could be raised to allow the boat to move quickly over water.",
      "As the design was targeted at a commuter crowd, the vehicle was named the Phoenix, for branding purposes. The design and name add an element of luxury, which was a major goal during design.",
      "This design was entirely modeled with Solidworks, using OneDrive for file sharing. It won first place among 11 teams, and was completed on top of a full-time engineering course load."
