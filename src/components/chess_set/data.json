      "In my senior year of high school, I began to learn chess, and I wanted a set to travel with. However, I didn't like any of the designs that I saw on Amazon, so I decided to make my own. I had access to an impressive machine shop and equally impressive CAD tools, so I decided to make my own set out of aluminum.",
      "At right is one of the original renderings of the entire set. I modeled each piece in SolidWorks and exported the STL files to Rhino 3D, where I was then able to render them with Flamingo. The board is a later project and one that I could cut on standard woodworking tools. I have a model and a process planned, but the pieces will come first.",
      "Apart from the knight and one face of the king, the pieces are finished. I turned them on a HAAS 4-tool CNC lathe. Unfortunately, I did not have the foresight to take videos at the time, and my backup models were stolen with my laptop just before college."

      "The main problem was the knight, since it is the only piece on the board that cannot be turned and still look like a traditional knight. It would be immensely difficult to cut on a 3-axis machine, but not nearly so difficult on a 5-axis machine. Luckily for me, the UW has just such a machine in one of the engineering makerspaces.",
      "I have no margin for error with the final aluminum blanks, so I am currently prototyping the knight in wood on a Pocket NC desktop machine. At right is a 1 3/8 to 1 scale model in wood that I successfully cut. I now have to solve a problem with software updates on the machine and figure out how to cut aluminum on such a small machine."
