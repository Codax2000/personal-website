      "The amplifier had to have a gain of 45 dB with a 100 MHz unity-gain frequency when driving a load of 1 pF. I was able to meet these specs by using a single-stage cascode topology.",
      "I had done a similar project in my undergraduate work, but that project required a second stage with much higher gain and load capacitance, and so it required Miller compensation. Luckily, that wasn't necessary for this project. For this project, I did not lay out the amplifier, but I did have to set up the biasing."
