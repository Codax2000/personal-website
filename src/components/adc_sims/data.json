      "Using an ideal model of a flash quantizer, I modeled a 2nd order delta-sigma modulator. The block diagram is at right. Since the digital filters are complicated and often not implemented on chip in research, they are also not added in my simulation. Instead of the final output, I ran the FFT on the quantizer output.",
      "The input, u[n], is a continuous analog signal, and the output, v[n], is the quantized digital output with shaped output noise."

      "At right is the FFT output from the 2nd order delta-sigma modulator. It is shown with and without DWA to account for DAC mismatch. Notice the harmonics with DAC mismatch. With standard rotational data-weighted averaging (DWA), the harmonics are nearly eliminated and the SNDR is greatly increased. Shown at right is a comparison of noise spectra of a 2nd-order DSM with and without DWA.",
      "The red line down the middle of the plot marks the ADC bandwidth. Since delta-sigma modulators are oversampling converters, the ideal is to shape the quantization noise out of band. The greater the oversampling ratio (OSR), the better the SNDR. In this case, the OSR was 64."

There is an error in the first bit comparison of 0.0625 in the first plot. Notice that with redundancy included in the second plot, there is no DNL error regardless of the first bit comparison."
