    "I developed this project to learn more about React.js, D3.js, and Spring Boot. The data vizualization can be panned and zoomed, and most of the countries can be clicked, and the vizualization will be zoomed to a bounding box. This is not perfect, and I am not entirely sure why. Since it appears random as to whether a country can be clicked or not, I suspect it is due to the topojson file I am using to plot the countries. The scatterplot on the bottom also has brushing that filters what is shown on the map. The data is fetched via a rest API that communicates with the database, and queries based on the parameters specified in the form at the top of the page.",
    "The website employs elements of multiple examples from the D3.js documentation, which I adapted for my own use. It uses the USGS earthquake feed to build up a MongoDB database, which is hosted on Microsoft Azure. The website is also hosted on Azure, as it makes sense to me to deploy the app where the database is located.",
    "There is currently a problem with CORS blocking the request, so queries have been disabled for now. I am working on the problem and will fix it as soon as possible"
