      "In my senior year of high school, I began to learn chess, and I wanted a set to travel with. However, I didn't like any of the designs that I saw on Amazon, so I decided to make my own. I had access to an impressive machine shop and equally impressive CAD tools, so I decided to make my own set out of aluminum."

      "The main problem was the knight, since it is the only piece on the board that cannot be turned and still look like a traditional knight. It would be immensely difficult to cut on a 3-axis machine, but not nearly so difficult on a 5-axis machine. Luckily for me, the UW has just such a machine in one of the engineering makerspaces."
